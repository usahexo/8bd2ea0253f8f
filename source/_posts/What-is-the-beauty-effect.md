#  What is the beauty effect?

The beauty effect is the phenomenon that beautiful people are judged more positively than those who are not considered as attractive. The term was coined in the early 1970s by psychologists and researchers who were interested in the effects of physical attractiveness on various life outcomes. Some of these life outcomes include hiring decisions, dating and mating, educational attainment, and income.

There are a few proposed explanations for why the beauty effect exists. One explanation is that we are hardwired to be attracted to certain physical features because they signal good genes or health. Evolutionarily speaking, it would make sense for humans to be drawn to physically healthy individuals because they are likely to produce healthier offspring. Another explanation is that we live in a society that places a lot of value on attractiveness. Attractive people tend to be considered more desirable partners, they often have an easier time getting hired, and they often earn more money than those who are considered less attractive.

Despite the existence of the beauty effect, there is some evidence that suggests that attractiveness is not always beneficial. For example, research has shown that attractive defendants are more likely to be found guilty in court than those who are considered unattractive. Additionally, studies have shown that attractive people can sometimes face discrimination in the workplace.

#  How long does it last?

The shelf life of CBD oil is one of the most commonly asked questions. Unfortunately, there’s no definitive answer since it depends on a variety of factors, including the quality of the oil and how it’s stored.

Generally speaking, CBD oil has a shelf life of around 18 months. However, if it’s exposed to heat or light, it will degrade more quickly. So, if you’re not going to use your CBD oil right away, it’s best to store it in a dark, cool place.
